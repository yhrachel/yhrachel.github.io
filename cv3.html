<h3>
1. When the kittens get home, put it in the ready toilet and let it smell it; then take it to the food bowl and water bowl, finally put it in the cat's nest. Kittens generally do not fear or drilling into the bed, the kitten will walk around, it is familiar to the new environment yet. Do not interfere too much with its freedom of action, make it as familiar As possible as the environment, as soon as possible into the family very helpful.
<h3>
2, kittens three months after the vision will mature mature, at night for three months below the kitten to open a lamp or wall lamp, so that it can not find the toilet and bed in the toilet.
<h3>
3, it is best to ask the cat before the owner of the nest to sleep in the bedding bedding, back pad in the new cat nest, will reduce its sense of discomfort, little to fast and it build feelings.
<H3>
4, ask it to eat what brand of cat food every day, eat a few meals a day, how much weight and so on. In the first two days before the initial home, although the kitten is very strong adaptability, but also because the Environment is not stable enough to change the mood, so the best food with the same cat food. If you want to give your kitten new cat food, you can 1 to 2 weeks to gradually complete this change, first in its original cat food mixed With a small amount of new cat food, slowly increase the amount of new cat food, Gradually let it adapt to your food formula, to prevent sudden changes in food caused by indigestion.
